    //I started out taking anything apart to figure out how it works. In the begging I didn’t always get things back to together correctly, but thankfully I got better with practice. This was the start to my pasination for anything with wheels. Quickly I figured out my passion was in cars. In high-school I went through the Auto-tech program. I then got a Job at My local Ford dealer out of high-school. After a while I decided to go to college where I graduated from the Ford ASSET program with my Associates in Applied Science. After being at the dealer for 16 years I found I wanted to help customers more than I could at the dealer. Now I’m focusing on helping people gain confidence to make good decisions on maintenance and repairs for their vehicle.
